# webex-client-tracker-powershell

This script will check Webex for the latest version of the client desktop app and download it.

## Running the script

This script requires one mandatory parameter, which is the name of your Cisco Webex site without `.webex.com`.  If your Webex site is `mysite.webex.com` you would run the script like this:

```bash
.\app.ps1 -site mysite
```
